        <h2>My Name</h2>
        <p>KYLE JONES</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kyle, I live in Manchester, have done all of my life. I have worked in customer service most of my working life but I have also worked as a security guard and a Doorman.
            I really enjoyed customer service but I feel as though I stagnated within in the role and needed a fresh challenge, my time as a security guard was spent in construction, I left
            this role due to having to work 82 hours a week, it had a real impact on my health and I had to leave. Being a doorman was definitely a challenge, something I wanted to try but having
            to deal with drunk people on a regular basis was frustrating. I left that role when a guy tried to enter the club I was working on with knives, he became hostile and he had to be restrained
            until police arrived, I went back to customer service after this incident.</p>
            <p>I have decided to change career fields and I am looking for a role within IT, hopefully as a Data Analyst but I am happy to work in any field relating to this so I can get my foot
            in the door.</p>
